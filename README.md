This hack contains of two parts, the functional website and the website design. 
The website design can be found here: https://tinyurl.com/Com-muniWebDesign, and the functional website can be found here: https://com-muni.tech.
The functional website has a landing page, a login page, example posts, and an about page. The web design has the planned vision of all of those pages, as well as animations that show how someone would make a post. 
![Inspiration](/assets/Titles/Inspiration.png)
We were inspired by the infamous Craigslist "missed connections" forum. We didn't like the dated look of Craigslist, and felt like we could make something more user-friendly and visually appealing. We took inspiration from current social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr, as well as taking inspiration from existing web-pages in order to design our final product.
![What it does](/assets/Titles/WhatItDoes.png)
Com-muni's goal is to encourage connections. In order to do this, we conceptualized a website that exists in the form of posts. When you post, it posts to a database that allows views to see a title and the post contents, as well as your username at the bottom. When you click on the username of someone who posted, you will be able to send them a message.
