This hack contains of two parts, the functional website and the website design. 
The website design can be found here: https://tinyurl.com/Com-muniWebDesign, and the functional website can be found here: https://com-muni.tech.
The functional website has a landing page, a login page, example posts, and an about page. The web design has the planned vision of all of those pages, as well as animations that show how someone would make a post. 

![Inspiration](/assets/Titles/Inspiration.png)
We were inspired by the infamous Craigslist "missed connections" forum. We didn't like the dated look of Craigslist, and felt like we could make something more user-friendly and visually appealing. We took inspiration from current social media sites like Twitter and Tumblr, as well as taking inspiration from existing web-pages in order to design our final product.

![What it does](/assets/Titles/WhatItDoes.png)
Com-muni's goal is to encourage connections. In order to do this, we conceptualized a website that exists in the form of posts. When you post, it posts to a database that allows views to see a title and the post contents, as well as your username at the bottom. When you click on the username of someone who posted, you will be able to send them a message. To view the messages you recieved, click the mail icon in the top right corner. There, you can open the mail and write a reply.

![How we built it](/assets/Titles/HowWeBuiltIt.png)
The web design was built using Figma, and branding and logos were done in Adobe Illustrator. The website was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

![Challenges we ran into](/assets/Titles/Challenges.png)
This was our designer's second time using Figma for interface design, so she had to learn how to use Figma at the same time as learning how to design a website. Prototyping was the hardest part, but she figured it out in the end!

![What we learned](/assets/Titles/WhatWeLearned.png)
Our graphic designer learned how to use Figma to design and conceptulize a website. Her favorite part was learning how prototyping worked, and she especially enjoyed seeing the animations it created! She also learned how to communicate her vision with her partner.
